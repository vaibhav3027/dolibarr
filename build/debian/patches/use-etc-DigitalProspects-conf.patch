Description: Enable /etc/DigitalProspects/conf.php so that we use packaged libraries
 Update some PHP include files to refer to /etc/DigitalProspects/conf.php
 instead of the in-tree conf/conf.php.
 .
 /etc/DigitalProspects/conf.php configures DigitalProspects to use packaged libraries
 instead of the embedded ones.
